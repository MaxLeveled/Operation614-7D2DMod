# Operation614-7D2DMod
This is a 7 Days to Die mod, it can be installed by dropping the "Operation 614" folder into  C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/Mods

This Mod is 100% server side, requiring no installation on client side.

Features:

- Elite Zombies:
	- SWAT	
	- Hazmat	
	- Wight
- Elite Gun Mods:
	- Tier 1, 2, 3, and Tier 4 gun damage mods	
	- Elite Killer Mod for all weapons	
- Elite Armors:
	- Elite Heavy Armor Hazmat set	
	- Elite Light Armor Ghillie set	
- Elite Weapons:
	- Elite Machete	
	- Elite Chainsaw
- Gameplay:
	- Headshots do 100% damage, all other body shots will only do 10%. I recommend keeping zombie counts high, but no runners; that really adds to the intensity!
	- SWAT Zombies have an AOE Slow Debuff that will trigger once they're damaged. It will keep slowing you down until they are killed, they should be secondary targets unless they are hit!
	- Removed Cop Zombie Vomit
	- Elite Zombies begin spawning above Game Stage 100, and become increasingly frequent the higher you go. The most Elites spawn in the Wastelands and Snow Biomes!

Planned:

- Elite Quests
- Elite Guns
- More Elite Zombies
- Elite Vehicles
- Elite Building Blocks
- Compatibility/Integration patch for Izayo's gun packs, as their guns are some of the best modded guns available.
